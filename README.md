# 🎵 Music Player

Hello! 👋  
This is a practice project I built to get better at working with files and media in JavaScript.  
It’s a simple but useful music player with features like:

- 🌙 Dark mode  
- 🔊 Volume control  
- 💖 Favorites list  
- 🔁 Repeat track  
- 📃 Playlist  

This project was built using **Vanilla JavaScript** and **Pure CSS**, without any frameworks.

## 💬 About the Project

While building this app, I faced some fun challenges like working with audio files, syncing buttons with the player, designing with CSS, and creating a smooth user experience.  
This project helped me understand how to work with media in JavaScript and organize code without using extra libraries.
